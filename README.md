## 🚀 Features
- **Objective**: Classify images of dogs into their respective breeds.
- **Dataset**: Uses a labeled dataset containing images of various dog breeds (e.g., [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/)).
- **Model Architecture**: Implements advanced deep learning architectures like:
  - **ResNet**
  - **EfficientNet**
  - **VGG**
  - custom CNN model
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Resizes and normalizes images for model input.
  - Applies **data augmentation** techniques (rotations, flips, zooms) to improve generalization.
